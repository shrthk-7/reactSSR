### React Server Side Rendering v/s Client Side Rendering

---

In SSR, the starting template is rendered in the server then the generated html page is sent to the client. When react is fully loaded in the client side, the starting html page is **`hydrated`**

In CSR, the whole html page is dynamically generated in the client side, starting from an empty html page.

---

To run it in your local machine, clone the repo, install node modules, build the project using `npm run build`

For CSR: `npm run dev`  
For SSR: `npm run ssr`
